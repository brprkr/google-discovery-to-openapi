            Required. The performance goal the bidding strategy will attempt to
            meet or beat, in micros of the advertiser's currency or in micro of
            the ROAS (Return On Advertising Spend) value which is also based on
            advertiser's currency. Must be greater than or equal to a billable
            unit of the given currency and smaller or equal to upper bounds.
            Each performance_goal_type has its upper bound: * when
            performance_goal_type is
            `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_CPA`, upper bound is
            10000.00 USD. * when performance_goal_type is
            `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_CPC`, upper bound is 1000.00
            USD. * when performance_goal_type is
            `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_VIEWABLE_CPM`, upper bound
            is 1000.00 USD. * when performance_goal_type is
            `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_CUSTOM_ALGO`, upper bound is
            1000.00 and lower bound is 0.01. Example: If set to
            `BIDDING_STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE_GOAL_TYPE_VIEWABLE_CPM`, the bid price
            will be based on the probability that each available impression will
            be viewable. For example, if viewable CPM target is $2 and an
            impression is 40% likely to be viewable, the bid price will be $0.80
            CPM (40% of $2). For example, 1500000 represents 1.5 standard units
            of the currency or ROAS value.
