              Has a good track record of a very low spam rate, and complies with
              Gmail's sender guidelines. Mail will rarely be marked by the spam
              filter.
            - >-
              Known to send good mail, but is prone to sending a low volume of
              spam intermittently. Most of the email from this entity will have
              a fair deliverability rate, except when there is a notable
              increase in spam levels.
            - >-
              Known to send a considerable volume of spam regularly, and mail
              from this sender will likely be marked as spam.

              History of sending an enormously high volume of spam. Mail coming
              from this entity will almost always be rejected at SMTP level or
              marked as spam.
