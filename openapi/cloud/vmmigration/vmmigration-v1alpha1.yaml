        The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
        different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It
        is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message
        contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error
        details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work
        with it in the [API Design
        Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

        CloneJob describes the process of creating a clone of a MigratingVM to
        the requested target based on the latest successful uploaded snapshots.
        While the migration cycles of a MigratingVm take place, it is possible
        to verify the uploaded VM can be started in the cloud, by creating a
        clone. The clone can be created without any downtime, and it is created
        using the latest snapshots which are already in the cloud. The cloneJob
        is only responsible for its work, not its products, which means once it
        is finished, it will never touch the instance it created. It will only
        delete it in case of the CloneJob being cancelled or upon failure to
        clone.
