        Represents civil time (or occasionally physical time). This type can
        represent a civil time in one of a few possible ways: * When utc_offset
        is set and time_zone is unset: a civil time on a calendar day with a
        particular offset from UTC. * When time_zone is set and utc_offset is
        unset: a civil time on a calendar day in a particular time zone. * When
        neither time_zone nor utc_offset is set: a civil time on a calendar day
        in local time. The date is relative to the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar.
        If year, month, or day are 0, the DateTime is considered not to have a
        specific year, month, or day respectively. This type may also be used to
        represent a physical time if all the date and time fields are set and
        either case of the `time_offset` oneof is set. Consider using
        `Timestamp` message for physical time instead. If your use case also
        would like to store the user's timezone, that can be done in another
        field. This type is more flexible than some applications may want. Make
        sure to document and validate your application's limitations.

        The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
        different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It
        is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message
        contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error
        details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work
        with it in the [API Design
        Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

    GoogleTypePostalAddress:

      description: >-
        Represents a postal address, e.g. for postal delivery or payments

        a premise, P.O. Box or similar. It is not intended to model geographical
        locations (roads, towns, mountains). In typical usage an address would
        be created via user input or from importing existing data, depending on
        the type of process. Advice on address input / editing: - Use an
        internationalization-ready address widget such as
        https://github.com/google/libaddressinput) - Users should not be
        presented with UI elements for input or editing of fields outside
        countries where that field is used. For more guidance on how to use this
        schema, please see: https://support.google.com/business/answer/6397478
      id: GoogleTypePostalAddress
      properties:
        sortingCode:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. Additional, country-specific, sorting code. This is not
            used in most regions. Where it is used, the value is either a string
            like "CEDEX", optionally followed by a number (e.g. "CEDEX 7"), or
            just a number alone, representing the "sector code" (Jamaica),
            "delivery area indicator" (Malawi) or "post office indicator" (e.g.
            Côte d'Ivoire).
        sublocality:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. Sublocality of the address. For example, this can be
            neighborhoods, boroughs, districts.
        organization:
          type: string
          description: Optional. The name of the organization at the address.
        locality:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. Generally refers to the city/town portion of the address.
            Examples: US city, IT comune, UK post town. In regions of the world
            where localities are not well defined or do not fit into this
            structure well, leave locality empty and use address_lines.
        administrativeArea:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. Highest administrative subdivision which is used for
            postal addresses of a country or region. For example, this can be a
            state, a province, an oblast, or a prefecture. Specifically, for
            Spain this is the province and not the autonomous community (e.g.
            "Barcelona" and not "Catalonia"). Many countries don't use an
            administrative area in postal addresses. E.g. in Switzerland this
            should be left unpopulated.
        postalCode:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. Postal code of the address. Not all countries use or
            require postal codes to be present, but where they are used, they
            may trigger additional validation with other parts of the address
            (e.g. state/zip validation in the U.S.A.).
        recipients:
          items:
            type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. The recipient at the address. This field may, under
            certain circumstances, contain multiline information. For example,
            it might contain "care of" information.
          type: array
        addressLines:
          description: >-
            Unstructured address lines describing the lower levels of an
            address. Because values in address_lines do not have type
            information and may sometimes contain multiple values in a single
            field (e.g. "Austin, TX"), it is important that the line order is
            clear. The order of address lines should be "envelope order" for the
            country/region of the address. In places where this can vary (e.g.
            Japan), address_language is used to make it explicit (e.g. "ja" for
            large-to-small ordering and "ja-Latn" or "en" for small-to-large).
            This way, the most specific line of an address can be selected based
            on the language. The minimum permitted structural representation of
            an address consists of a region_code with all remaining information
            placed in the address_lines. It would be possible to format such an
            address very approximately without geocoding, but no semantic
            reasoning could be made about any of the address components until it
            was at least partially resolved. Creating an address only containing
            a region_code and address_lines, and then geocoding is the
            recommended way to handle completely unstructured addresses (as
            opposed to guessing which parts of the address should be localities
            or administrative areas).
          items:
            type: string
          type: array
        languageCode:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Optional. BCP-47 language code of the contents of this address (if
            known). This is often the UI language of the input form or is
            expected to match one of the languages used in the address'
            country/region, or their transliterated equivalents. This can affect
            formatting in certain countries, but is not critical to the
            correctness of the data and will never affect any validation or
            other non-formatting related operations. If this value is not known,
            it should be omitted (rather than specifying a possibly incorrect
            default). Examples: "zh-Hant", "ja", "ja-Latn", "en".
        regionCode:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Required. CLDR region code of the country/region of the address.
            This is never inferred and it is up to the user to ensure the value
            is correct. See https://cldr.unicode.org/ and
            https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/30/supplemental/territory_information.html

          description: >-
            The decimal value, as a string. The string representation consists
            of an optional sign, `+` (`U+002B`) or `-` (`U+002D`), followed by a
            sequence of zero or more decimal digits ("the integer"), optionally
            followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. An empty
            string **should** be interpreted as `0`. The fraction consists of a
            decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string
            must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the
            fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the
            fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of
            the character `e` (`U+0065`) or `E` (`U+0045`) followed by one or
            more decimal digits. Services **should** normalize decimal values
            before storing them by: - Removing an explicitly-provided `+` sign
            (`+2.5` -> `2.5`). - Replacing a zero-length integer value with `0`
            (`.5` -> `0.5`). - Coercing the exponent character to upper-case,
            with explicit sign (`2.5e8` -> `2.5E+8`). - Removing an
            explicitly-provided zero exponent (`2.5E0` -> `2.5`). Services
            **may** perform additional normalization based on its own needs and
            the internal decimal implementation selected, such as shifting the
            decimal point and exponent value together (example: `2.5E-1` <->
            `0.25`). Additionally, services **may** preserve trailing zeroes in
            the fraction to indicate increased precision, but are not required
            to do so. Note that only the `.` character is supported to divide
            the integer and the fraction; `,` **should not** be supported
            regardless of locale. Additionally, thousand separators **should
            not** be supported. If a service does support them, values **must**
            be normalized. The ENBF grammar is: DecimalString = '' | [Sign]
            Significand [Exponent]; Sign = '+' | '-'; Significand = Digits '.' |
            [Digits] '.' Digits; Exponent = ('e' | 'E') [Sign] Digits; Digits =
            { '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' };
            Services **should** clearly document the range of supported values,
            the maximum supported precision (total number of digits), and, if
            applicable, the scale (number of digits after the decimal point), as
            well as how it behaves when receiving out-of-bounds values. Services
            **may** choose to accept values passed as input even when the value
            has a higher precision or scale than the service supports, and
            **should** round the value to fit the supported scale.
            Alternatively, the service **may** error with `400 Bad Request`
            (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC) if precision would be lost. Services
            **should** error with `400 Bad Request` (`INVALID_ARGUMENT` in gRPC)
            if the service receives a value outside of the supported range.
