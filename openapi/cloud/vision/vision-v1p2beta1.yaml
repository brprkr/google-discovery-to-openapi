            detection. For languages based on the Latin alphabet, setting
            `language_hints` is not needed. In rare cases, when the language of
            the text in the image is known, setting a hint will help get better
            results (although it will be a significant hindrance if the hint is
            wrong). Text detection returns an error if one or more of the
            specified languages is not one of the [supported
            languages](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/languages).

            The `fd_bounding_poly` bounding polygon is tighter than the
            `boundingPoly`, and encloses only the skin part of the face.
            Typically, it is used to eliminate the face from any image analysis
            that detects the "amount of skin" visible in an image. It is not
            based on the landmarker results, only on the initial face detection,
            hence the fd (face detection) prefix.

            Google Cloud Storage URI prefix where the results will be stored.
            Results will be in JSON format and preceded by its corresponding
            input URI prefix. This field can either represent a gcs file prefix
            or gcs directory. In either case, the uri should be unique because
            in order to get all of the output files, you will need to do a
            wildcard gcs search on the uri prefix you provide. Examples: * File
            Prefix: gs://bucket-name/here/filenameprefix The output files will
            be created in gs://bucket-name/here/ and the names of the output
            files will begin with "filenameprefix". * Directory Prefix:
            gs://bucket-name/some/location/ The output files will be created in
            gs://bucket-name/some/location/ and the names of the output files
            could be anything because there was no filename prefix specified. If
            multiple outputs, each response is still AnnotateFileResponse, each
            of which contains some subset of the full list of
            AnnotateImageResponse. Multiple outputs can happen if, for example,
            the output JSON is too large and overflows into multiple sharded
            files.

            The `fd_bounding_poly` bounding polygon is tighter than the
            `boundingPoly`, and encloses only the skin part of the face.
            Typically, it is used to eliminate the face from any image analysis
            that detects the "amount of skin" visible in an image. It is not
            based on the landmarker results, only on the initial face detection,
            hence the fd (face detection) prefix.

            and/or y coordinates may not be generated in the `BoundingPoly` (the
            polygon will be unbounded) if only a partial face appears in the

            The `fd_bounding_poly` bounding polygon is tighter than the

            Typically, it is used to eliminate the face from any image analysis
            that detects the "amount of skin" visible in an image. It is not
            based on the landmarker results, only on the initial face detection,
            hence the fd (face detection) prefix.

            Google Cloud Storage URI prefix where the results will be stored.
            Results will be in JSON format and preceded by its corresponding
            input URI prefix. This field can either represent a gcs file prefix
            or gcs directory. In either case, the uri should be unique because
            in order to get all of the output files, you will need to do a
            wildcard gcs search on the uri prefix you provide. Examples: * File
            Prefix: gs://bucket-name/here/filenameprefix The output files will
            be created in gs://bucket-name/here/ and the names of the output
            files will begin with "filenameprefix". * Directory Prefix:
            gs://bucket-name/some/location/ The output files will be created in
            gs://bucket-name/some/location/ and the names of the output files
            could be anything because there was no filename prefix specified. If
            multiple outputs, each response is still AnnotateFileResponse, each
            of which contains some subset of the full list of
            AnnotateImageResponse. Multiple outputs can happen if, for example,
            the output JSON is too large and overflows into multiple sharded
            files.

            The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That

            alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This
            means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a
            value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This
            uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it
            is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value
            being unset. If omitted, this color object is rendered as a solid
            color (as if the alpha value had been explicitly given a value of
            1.0).
      id: Color
      type: object
      description: >-
        Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is
        designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations
        in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this
        representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of
        `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's
        `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little
        work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in
        JavaScript. This reference page doesn't have information about the
        absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for
        example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications
        should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be
        decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors
        as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by
        at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ...
        public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha =
        protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return
        new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(),
        protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color
        toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed();
        float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float)
        color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder
        = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green /
        denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha();
        if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder()
        .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return
        resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static
        UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red];
        float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue];
        FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if
        (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return
        [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static
        Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if
        (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return
        nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red];
        [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha <= 0.9999) {
        [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease];
        return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor
