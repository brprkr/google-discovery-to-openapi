        TextAnnotation contains a structured representation of OCR extracted
        text. The hierarchy of an OCR extracted text structure is like this:
        TextAnnotation -> Page -> Block -> Paragraph -> Word -> Symbol Each
        structural component, starting from Page, may further have their own
        properties. Properties describe detected languages, breaks etc.. Please

    Color:
      description: >-
        Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is
        designed for simplicity of conversion to and from color representations
        in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this
        representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of
        `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's
        `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little
        work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in
        JavaScript. This reference page doesn't have information about the
        absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value—for
        example, sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020. By default, applications
        should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be
        decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors
        as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by
        at most `1e-5`. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ...
        public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha =
        protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return

        protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color
        toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed();
        float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float)
        color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder
        = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green /
        denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha();
        if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder()
        .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return
        resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static
        UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red];
        float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue];
        FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if
        (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return
        [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static

            The fraction of this color that should be applied to the pixel. That
            is, the final pixel color is defined by the equation: `pixel color =
            alpha * (this color) + (1.0 - alpha) * (background color)` This
            means that a value of 1.0 corresponds to a solid color, whereas a
            value of 0.0 corresponds to a completely transparent color. This

            Google Cloud Storage URI prefix where the results will be stored.
            Results will be in JSON format and preceded by its corresponding
            input URI prefix. This field can either represent a gcs file prefix
            or gcs directory. In either case, the uri should be unique because
            in order to get all of the output files, you will need to do a
            wildcard gcs search on the uri prefix you provide. Examples: * File
            Prefix: gs://bucket-name/here/filenameprefix The output files will
            be created in gs://bucket-name/here/ and the names of the output
            files will begin with "filenameprefix". * Directory Prefix:
            gs://bucket-name/some/location/ The output files will be created in
            gs://bucket-name/some/location/ and the names of the output files
            could be anything because there was no filename prefix specified. If
            multiple outputs, each response is still AnnotateFileResponse, each
            of which contains some subset of the full list of
            AnnotateImageResponse. Multiple outputs can happen if, for example,
            the output JSON is too large and overflows into multiple sharded
            files.

        TextAnnotation contains a structured representation of OCR extracted
        text. The hierarchy of an OCR extracted text structure is like this:
        TextAnnotation -> Page -> Block -> Paragraph -> Word -> Symbol Each
        structural component, starting from Page, may further have their own
        properties. Properties describe detected languages, breaks etc.. Please

            The bounding box for the paragraph. The vertices are in the order of
            top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left. When a rotation of
            the bounding box is detected the rotation is represented as around
            the top-left corner as defined when the text is read in the
            'natural' orientation. For example: * when the text is horizontal it
            might look like: 0----1 | | 3----2 * when it's rotated 180 degrees
            around the top-left corner it becomes: 2----3 | | 1----0 and the
            vertex order will still be (0, 1, 2, 3).

            be created in gs://bucket-name/here/ and the names of the output

            gs://bucket-name/some/location/ The output files will be created in
            gs://bucket-name/some/location/ and the names of the output files
            could be anything because there was no filename prefix specified. If
            multiple outputs, each response is still AnnotateFileResponse, each

            input URI prefix. This field can either represent a gcs file prefix
            or gcs directory. In either case, the uri should be unique because
            in order to get all of the output files, you will need to do a
            wildcard gcs search on the uri prefix you provide. Examples: * File
            Prefix: gs://bucket-name/here/filenameprefix The output files will
            be created in gs://bucket-name/here/ and the names of the output
            files will begin with "filenameprefix". * Directory Prefix:
            gs://bucket-name/some/location/ The output files will be created in
            gs://bucket-name/some/location/ and the names of the output files
            could be anything because there was no filename prefix specified. If
            multiple outputs, each response is still AnnotateFileResponse, each
            of which contains some subset of the full list of
            AnnotateImageResponse. Multiple outputs can happen if, for example,

            The bounding box for the paragraph. The vertices are in the order of
            top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left. When a rotation of
            the bounding box is detected the rotation is represented as around
            the top-left corner as defined when the text is read in the
            'natural' orientation. For example: * when the text is horizontal it
            might look like: 0----1 | | 3----2 * when it's rotated 180 degrees
            around the top-left corner it becomes: 2----3 | | 1----0 and the
            vertex order will still be (0, 1, 2, 3).
