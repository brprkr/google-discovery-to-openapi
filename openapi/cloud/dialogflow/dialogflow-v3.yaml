          description: >-
            The handlers for parameter-level events, used to provide reprompt
            for the parameter or transition to a different page/flow. The
            supported events are: * `sys.no-match-`, where N can be from 1 to 6
            * `sys.no-match-default` * `sys.no-input-`, where N can be from 1 to
            6 * `sys.no-input-default` * `sys.invalid-parameter`
            `initial_prompt_fulfillment` provides the first prompt for the
            parameter. If the user's response does not fill the parameter, a
            no-match/no-input event will be triggered, and the fulfillment
            associated with the `sys.no-match-1`/`sys.no-input-1` handler (if
            defined) will be called to provide a prompt. The
            `sys.no-match-2`/`sys.no-input-2` handler (if defined) will respond
            to the next no-match/no-input event, and so on. A
            `sys.no-match-default` or `sys.no-input-default` handler will be
            used to handle all following no-match/no-input events after all
            numbered no-match/no-input handlers for the parameter are consumed.
            A `sys.invalid-parameter` handler can be defined to handle the case
            where the parameter values have been `invalidated` by webhook. For
            example, if the user's response fill the parameter, however the
            parameter was invalidated by webhook, the fulfillment associated
            with the `sys.invalid-parameter` handler (if defined) will be called
            to provide a prompt. If the event handler for the corresponding
            event can't be found on the parameter, `initial_prompt_fulfillment`
            will be re-prompted.

            the case of requests that are mistakenly matched, since training
            phrases assigned to fallback intents act as negative examples that
            triggers no-match event.

        signal is up to you and your handoff procedures. You may set this, for
        example: * In the entry_fulfillment of a Page if entering the page
        indicates something went extremely wrong in the conversation. * In a
        webhook response when you determine that the customer issue can only be

        The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
        different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It
        is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message
        contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error
        details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work
        with it in the [API Design

        Session entity types are referred to as **User** entity types and are
        entities that are built for an individual user such as favorites,
        preferences, playlists, and so on. You can redefine a session entity
        type at the session level to extend or replace a custom entity type at
        the user session level (we refer to the entity types defined at the
        agent level as "custom entity types"). Note: session entity types apply
        to all queries, regardless of the language. For more information about
        entity types, see the [Dialogflow
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview).

        Represents a response message that can be returned by a conversational
        agent. Response messages are also used for output audio synthesis. The
        approach is as follows: * If at least one OutputAudioText response is
        present, then all OutputAudioText responses are linearly concatenated,
        and the result is used for output audio synthesis. * If the
        OutputAudioText responses are a mixture of text and SSML, then the
        concatenated result is treated as SSML; otherwise, the result is treated
        as either text or SSML as appropriate. The agent designer should ideally
        use either text or SSML consistently throughout the bot design. *
        Otherwise, all Text responses are linearly concatenated, and the result
        is used for output audio synthesis. This approach allows for more
        sophisticated user experience scenarios, where the text displayed to the
        user may differ from what is heard.

        Each intent parameter has a type, called the entity type, which dictates
        exactly how data from an end-user expression is extracted. Dialogflow
        provides predefined system entities that can match many common types of
        data. For example, there are system entities for matching dates, times,
        colors, email addresses, and so on. You can also create your own custom
        entities for matching custom data. For example, you could define a
        vegetable entity that can match the types of vegetables available for
        purchase with a grocery store agent. For more information, see the
        [Entity
        guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview).

        audioEncoding:

            - Not specified.
            - Uncompressed 16-bit signed little-endian samples (Linear PCM).
            - >-
              [`FLAC`](https://xiph.org/flac/documentation.html) (Free Lossless
              Audio Codec) is the recommended encoding because it is lossless
              (therefore recognition is not compromised) and requires only about
              half the bandwidth of `LINEAR16`. `FLAC` stream encoding supports
              16-bit and 24-bit samples, however, not all fields in `STREAMINFO`
              are supported.
            - >-
              8-bit samples that compand 14-bit audio samples using G.711
              PCMU/mu-law.
            - >-
              Adaptive Multi-Rate Narrowband codec. `sample_rate_hertz` must be
              8000.
            - >-
              Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband codec. `sample_rate_hertz` must be
              16000.
            - >-
              Opus encoded audio frames in Ogg container
              ([OggOpus](https://wiki.xiph.org/OggOpus)). `sample_rate_hertz`
              must be 16000.
            - >-
              Although the use of lossy encodings is not recommended, if a very
              low bitrate encoding is required, `OGG_OPUS` is highly preferred
              over Speex encoding. The [Speex](https://speex.org/) encoding
              supported by Dialogflow API has a header byte in each block, as in
              MIME type `audio/x-speex-with-header-byte`. It is a variant of the
              RTP Speex encoding defined in [RFC
              5574](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5574). The stream is a
              sequence of blocks, one block per RTP packet. Each block starts
              with a byte containing the length of the block, in bytes, followed
              by one or more frames of Speex data, padded to an integral number
              of bytes (octets) as specified in RFC 5574. In other words, each
              RTP header is replaced with a single byte containing the block
              length. Only Speex wideband is supported. `sample_rate_hertz` must
              be 16000.

            detects the audio's voice has stopped or paused. In this case, once

        Dialogflow only uses this to determine which conversations were handed

        signal is up to you and your handoff procedures. You may set this, for
        example: * In the entry_fulfillment of a Page if entering the page
        indicates something went extremely wrong in the conversation. * In a
        webhook response when you determine that the customer issue can only be

            are concatenated. If the training phrase does not need to be
            annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the
            Part.text field set. If you want to annotate the training phrase,
            you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are
            populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the
            phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the

        Each intent parameter has a type, called the entity type, which dictates
        exactly how data from an end-user expression is extracted. Dialogflow
        provides predefined system entities that can match many common types of
        data. For example, there are system entities for matching dates, times,
        colors, email addresses, and so on. You can also create your own custom
        entities for matching custom data. For example, you could define a
        vegetable entity that can match the types of vegetables available for
        purchase with a grocery store agent. For more information, see the
        [Entity
        guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview).

      description: >-
        Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person
        says to you "they are orange", you need context in order to understand
        what "they" is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an
        end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in
        order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the
        flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by
        setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names.
        When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that
        intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more
        likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that
        correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about
        context, see the [Contexts
        guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).

            intents that are referenced in the currently active flow are
            included. - The matched intent is included. - Other intents that
            could have matched end-user input, but did not match because they
            are referenced by intent routes that are out of
            [scope](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/handler#scope),
            are included. - Other intents referenced by intent routes in scope
            that matched end-user input, but had a lower confidence score.

        determine which conversations should be counted as successful and

        entering the page indicates that the conversation succeeded. * In a
        webhook response when you determine that you handled the customer issue.

      description: >-
        Represents a response message that can be returned by a conversational
        agent. Response messages are also used for output audio synthesis. The
        approach is as follows: * If at least one OutputAudioText response is
        present, then all OutputAudioText responses are linearly concatenated,
        and the result is used for output audio synthesis. * If the
        OutputAudioText responses are a mixture of text and SSML, then the
        concatenated result is treated as SSML; otherwise, the result is treated
        as either text or SSML as appropriate. The agent designer should ideally
        use either text or SSML consistently throughout the bot design. *
        Otherwise, all Text responses are linearly concatenated, and the result
        is used for output audio synthesis. This approach allows for more
        sophisticated user experience scenarios, where the text displayed to the
        user may differ from what is heard.

        A Dialogflow CX conversation (session) can be described and visualized
        as a state machine. The states of a CX session are represented by pages.
        For each flow, you define many pages, where your combined pages can
        handle a complete conversation on the topics the flow is designed for.
        At any given moment, exactly one page is the current page, the current
        page is considered active, and the flow associated with that page is
        considered active. Every flow has a special start page. When a flow
        initially becomes active, the start page page becomes the current page.
        For each conversational turn, the current page will either stay the same
        or transition to another page. You configure each page to collect
        information from the end-user that is relevant for the conversational
        state represented by the page. For more information, see the [Page
        guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/page).

    GoogleCloudDialogflowCxV3EntityType:
      description: >-
        Entities are extracted from user input and represent parameters that are
        meaningful to your application. For example, a date range, a proper name
        such as a geographic location or landmark, and so on. Entities represent
        actionable data for your application. When you define an entity, you can
        also include synonyms that all map to that entity. For example, "soft
        drink", "soda", "pop", and so on. There are three types of entities: *
        **System** - entities that are defined by the Dialogflow API for common
        data types such as date, time, currency, and so on. A system entity is
        represented by the `EntityType` type. * **Custom** - entities that are
        defined by you that represent actionable data that is meaningful to your
        application. For example, you could define a `pizza.sauce` entity for
        red or white pizza sauce, a `pizza.cheese` entity for the different
        types of cheese on a pizza, a `pizza.topping` entity for different
        toppings, and so on. A custom entity is represented by the `EntityType`
        type. * **User** - entities that are built for an individual user such
        as favorites, preferences, playlists, and so on. A user entity is
        represented by the SessionEntityType type. For more information about
        entity types, see the [Dialogflow
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/entities-overview).

            * `sys.no-match-default` * `sys.no-input-`, where N can be from 1 to
            6 * `sys.no-input-default` * `sys.invalid-parameter`
            `initial_prompt_fulfillment` provides the first prompt for the
            parameter. If the user's response does not fill the parameter, a
            no-match/no-input event will be triggered, and the fulfillment
            associated with the `sys.no-match-1`/`sys.no-input-1` handler (if
            defined) will be called to provide a prompt. The
            `sys.no-match-2`/`sys.no-input-2` handler (if defined) will respond
            to the next no-match/no-input event, and so on. A

            used to handle all following no-match/no-input events after all
            numbered no-match/no-input handlers for the parameter are consumed.
            A `sys.invalid-parameter` handler can be defined to handle the case
            where the parameter values have been `invalidated` by webhook. For
            example, if the user's response fill the parameter, however the
            parameter was invalidated by webhook, the fulfillment associated
            with the `sys.invalid-parameter` handler (if defined) will be called
            to provide a prompt. If the event handler for the corresponding
            event can't be found on the parameter, `initial_prompt_fulfillment`
            will be re-prompted.

              [`FLAC`](https://xiph.org/flac/documentation.html) (Free Lossless
              Audio Codec) is the recommended encoding because it is lossless
              (therefore recognition is not compromised) and requires only about
              half the bandwidth of `LINEAR16`. `FLAC` stream encoding supports
              16-bit and 24-bit samples, however, not all fields in `STREAMINFO`
              are supported.

              Although the use of lossy encodings is not recommended, if a very
              low bitrate encoding is required, `OGG_OPUS` is highly preferred
              over Speex encoding. The [Speex](https://speex.org/) encoding
              supported by Dialogflow API has a header byte in each block, as in
              MIME type `audio/x-speex-with-header-byte`. It is a variant of the
              RTP Speex encoding defined in [RFC
              5574](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5574). The stream is a
              sequence of blocks, one block per RTP packet. Each block starts
              with a byte containing the length of the block, in bytes, followed
              by one or more frames of Speex data, padded to an integral number
              of bytes (octets) as specified in RFC 5574. In other words, each
              RTP header is replaced with a single byte containing the block
              length. Only Speex wideband is supported. `sample_rate_hertz` must
              be 16000.

        An intent categorizes an end-user's intention for one conversation turn.
        For each agent, you define many intents, where your combined intents can
        handle a complete conversation. When an end-user writes or says
        something, referred to as an end-user expression or end-user input,
        Dialogflow matches the end-user input to the best intent in your agent.
        Matching an intent is also known as intent classification. For more
        information, see the [intent

        Dialogflow contexts are similar to natural language context. If a person
        says to you "they are orange", you need context in order to understand
        what "they" is referring to. Similarly, for Dialogflow to handle an
        end-user expression like that, it needs to be provided with context in
        order to correctly match an intent. Using contexts, you can control the
        flow of a conversation. You can configure contexts for an intent by
        setting input and output contexts, which are identified by string names.
        When an intent is matched, any configured output contexts for that
        intent become active. While any contexts are active, Dialogflow is more
        likely to match intents that are configured with input contexts that
        correspond to the currently active contexts. For more information about
        context, see the [Contexts
        guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/contexts-overview).

        Flows represents the conversation flows when you build your chatbot
        agent. A flow consists of many pages connected by the transition routes.
        Conversations always start with the built-in Start Flow (with an all-0
        ID). Transition routes can direct the conversation session from the
        current flow (parent flow) to another flow (sub flow). When the sub flow
        is finished, Dialogflow will bring the session back to the parent flow,
        where the sub flow is started. Usually, when a transition route is
        followed by a matched intent, the intent will be "consumed". This means
        the intent won't activate more transition routes. However, when the
        followed transition route moves the conversation session into a
        different flow, the matched intent can be carried over and to be
        consumed in the target flow.

        something, referred to as an end-user expression or end-user input,
        Dialogflow matches the end-user input to the best intent in your agent.
        Matching an intent is also known as intent classification. For more

            Console does. Note: Do not forget to include whitespace at part
            boundaries, so the training phrase is well formatted when the parts
            are concatenated. If the training phrase does not need to be
            annotated with parameters, you just need a single part with only the
            Part.text field set. If you want to annotate the training phrase,
            you must create multiple parts, where the fields of each part are
            populated in one of two ways: - `Part.text` is set to a part of the
            phrase that has no parameters. - `Part.text` is set to a part of the

        A Dialogflow CX conversation (session) can be described and visualized
        as a state machine. The states of a CX session are represented by pages.
        For each flow, you define many pages, where your combined pages can
        handle a complete conversation on the topics the flow is designed for.
        At any given moment, exactly one page is the current page, the current
        page is considered active, and the flow associated with that page is
        considered active. Every flow has a special start page. When a flow
        initially becomes active, the start page page becomes the current page.
        For each conversational turn, the current page will either stay the same
        or transition to another page. You configure each page to collect
        information from the end-user that is relevant for the conversational
        state represented by the page. For more information, see the [Page
        guide](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/cx/docs/concept/page).

        the webhook. Fulfillments can be called at various stages in the Page or
        Form lifecycle. For example, when a DetectIntentRequest drives a session
        to enter a new page, the page's entry fulfillment can add a static
        response to the QueryResult in the returning DetectIntentResponse, call
        the webhook (for example, to load user data from a database), or both.

        Processes a natural language query and returns structured, actionable

        session entity types to be updated, which in turn might affect results
        of future queries. Note: Always use agent versions for production
        traffic. See [Versions and

        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`. Clients can use Operations.GetOperation
        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
        1, corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.
