        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns

        or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether
        the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful
        cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an
        operation with an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of
