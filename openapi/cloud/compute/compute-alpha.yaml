        networkMatch:
          description: >-
            A match condition that incoming packets are evaluated against for
            CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK security policies. If it matches, the
            corresponding 'action' is enforced. The match criteria for a rule
            consists of built-in match fields (like 'srcIpRanges') and
            potentially multiple user-defined match fields
            ('userDefinedFields'). Field values may be extracted directly from
            the packet or derived from it (e.g. 'srcRegionCodes'). Some fields
            may not be present in every packet (e.g. 'srcPorts'). A user-defined
            field is only present if the base header is found in the packet and
            the entire field is in bounds. Each match field may specify which
            values can match it, listing one or more ranges, prefixes, or exact
            values that are considered a match for the field. A field value must
            be present in order to match a specified match field. If no match
            values are specified for a match field, then any field value is
            considered to match it, and it's not required to be present. For
            strings specifying '*' is also equivalent to match all. For a packet
            to match a rule, all specified match fields must match the
            corresponding field values derived from the packet. Example:
            networkMatch: srcIpRanges: - "192.0.2.0/24" - "198.51.100.0/24"
            userDefinedFields: - name: "ipv4_fragment_offset" values: -
            "1-0x1fff" The above match condition matches packets with a source
            IP in 192.0.2.0/24 or 198.51.100.0/24 and a user-defined field named
            "ipv4_fragment_offset" with a value between 1 and 0x1fff inclusive.

            Valid values for `STATUS` are 403, 404, and 502. - rate_based_ban:
            limit client traffic to the configured threshold and ban the client
            if the traffic exceeds the threshold. Configure parameters for this
            action in RateLimitOptions. Requires rate_limit_options to be set. -
            redirect: redirect to a different target. This can either be an
            internal reCAPTCHA redirect, or an external URL-based redirect via a
            302 response. Parameters for this action can be configured via
            redirectOptions. This action is only supported in Global Security
            Policies of type CLOUD_ARMOR. - throttle: limit client traffic to
            the configured threshold. Configure parameters for this action in
            rateLimitOptions. Requires rate_limit_options to be set for this.

            customErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns

            policy configured in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes

            configuration: - UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy are
            configured with policies for 5xx and 4xx errors - A PathRule for
            /coming_soon/ is configured for the error code 404. If the request
            is for www.myotherdomain.com and a 404 is encountered, the policy
            under UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If a 404
            response is encountered for the request
            www.example.com/current_events/, the pathMatcher's policy takes
            effect. If however, the request for www.example.com/coming_soon/
            encounters a 404, the policy in PathRule.customErrorResponsePolicy

              The external VPN gateway has four public IP addresses; at the time
              of writing this API, the AWS virtual private gateway is an example
              which has four public IP addresses for high availability
              connections; there should be two VPN connections in the AWS
              virtual private gateway , each AWS VPN connection has two public
              IP addresses; please make sure to put two public IP addresses from
              one AWS VPN connection into interfaces 0 and 1 of this external
              VPN gateway, and put the other two public IP addresses from
              another AWS VPN connection into interfaces 2 and 3 of this
              external VPN gateway. When displaying highly available
              configuration status for the VPN tunnels connected to
              FOUR_IPS_REDUNDANCY external VPN gateway, Google will always
              detect whether interfaces 0 and 1 are connected on one interface
              of HA Cloud VPN gateway, and detect whether interfaces 2 and 3 are
              connected to another interface of the HA Cloud VPN gateway.

              The external VPN gateway has only one public IP address which
              internally provide redundancy or failover.
            - >-
              The external VPN gateway has two public IP addresses which are
              redundant with each other, the following two types of setup on
              your on-premises side would have this type of redundancy: (1) Two
              separate on-premises gateways, each with one public IP address,
              the two on-premises gateways are redundant with each other. (2) A
              single on-premise gateway with two public IP addresses that are
              redundant with eatch other.

        Represents an external VPN gateway. External VPN gateway is the
        on-premises VPN gateway(s) or another cloud provider's VPN gateway that
        connects to your Google Cloud VPN gateway. To create a highly available
        VPN from Google Cloud Platform to your VPN gateway or another cloud
        provider's VPN gateway, you must create a external VPN gateway resource
        with information about the other gateway. For more information about
        using external VPN gateways, see Creating an HA VPN gateway and tunnel

            following conditions are satisfied: 1. Instance's status is RUNNING.
            2. Instance's currentAction is NONE (in particular its liveness
            health check result was observed to be HEALTHY at least once as it
            passed VERIFYING). 3. There is no outgoing action on an instance
            triggered by IGM. By default, number of concurrently autohealed
            instances is smaller than the managed instance group target size.
            However, if a zonal managed instance group has only one instance, or
            a regional managed instance group has only one instance per zone,
            autohealing will recreate these instances when they become

            might be in the startup process. This prevents the MIG from
            prematurely recreating a VM. If the health check receives a healthy
            response during the initial delay, it indicates that the startup

            customErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns
            error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an
            error. If a policy for an error code is not configured for the
            RouteRule, a policy for the error code configured in
            pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. If one is
            not specified in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, the
            policy configured in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes
            effect. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following
            configuration: - UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy are
            configured with policies for 5xx and 4xx errors - A RouteRule for
            /coming_soon/ is configured for the error code 404. If the request
            is for www.myotherdomain.com and a 404 is encountered, the policy
            under UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If a 404
            response is encountered for the request
            www.example.com/current_events/, the pathMatcher's policy takes
            effect. If however, the request for www.example.com/coming_soon/
            encounters a 404, the policy in RouteRule.customErrorResponsePolicy
            takes effect. If any of the requests in this example encounter a 500
            error code, the policy at UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy
            takes effect. When used in conjunction with
            routeRules.routeAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence. Only
            once all retries are exhausted, the customErrorResponsePolicy is
            applied. While attempting a retry, if load balancer is successful in
            reaching the service, the customErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and
            the response from the service is returned to the client.
            customErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for Global External
            HTTP(S) load balancing.

            The priority of a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3,

        Opaque filter criteria used by load balancers to restrict routing
        configuration to a limited set of load balancing proxies. Proxies and
        sidecars involved in load balancing would typically present metadata to
        the load balancers that need to match criteria specified here. If a
        match takes place, the relevant configuration is made available to those
        proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if its
        filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the
        filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the
        metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all of
        its filterLabels must match with corresponding labels provided in the
        metadata. An example for using metadataFilters would be: if load
        balancing involves Envoys, they receive routing configuration when
        values in metadataFilters match values supplied in of their XDS requests
        to loadbalancers.

            explicitly using the port field in the health check. Supported by
            backend services for pass-through load balancers and backend
            services for proxy load balancers. Not supported by target pools.
            The health check supports all backends supported by the backend
            service provided the backend can be health checked. For example,
            GCE_VM_IP network endpoint groups, GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint
            groups, and instance group backends. USE_NAMED_PORT: Not supported.

            health check port by referring to the backend service. Only

            group backends, the health check uses the port number specified for
            each endpoint in the network endpoint group. For instance group
            backends, the health check uses the port number determined by

            gateway-error: Similar to 5xx, but only applies to response codes
            502, 503 or 504. - connect-failure: a retry is attempted on failures
            connecting to the instance or endpoint. For example, connection
            timeouts. - retriable-4xx: a retry is attempted if the instance or
            endpoint responds with a 4xx response code. The only error that you

              TIMEOUT (i.e.,the Health Check probe was not able to get a

              report the weight for a new backend (which is with 0.0.0.0 ip

            forwarding the request to the selected backend. If

            defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices. Only
            one of defaultRouteAction or defaultUrlRedirect must be set. URL

            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project

            compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendServices/backendService -
            global/backendServices/backendService If defaultRouteAction is also
            specified, advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites, take
            effect before sending the request to the backend. However, if
            defaultService is specified, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any
            weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if defaultRouteAction specifies
            any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be specified.
            Only one of defaultService, defaultUrlRedirect , or
            defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be set. Authorization

        defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy:
          description: >-
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer
            returns error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds
            with an error. This policy takes effect at the PathMatcher level and
            applies only when no policy has been defined for the error code at
            lower levels like RouteRule and PathRule within this PathMatcher. If
            an error code does not have a policy defined in
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, then a policy defined for the
            error code in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect.
            For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration: -
            UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is configured with policies
            for 5xx and 4xx errors - A RouteRule for /coming_soon/ is configured
            for the error code 404. If the request is for www.myotherdomain.com
            and a 404 is encountered, the policy under
            UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If a 404
            response is encountered for the request
            www.example.com/current_events/, the pathMatcher's policy takes
            effect. If however, the request for www.example.com/coming_soon/
            encounters a 404, the policy in RouteRule.customErrorResponsePolicy
            takes effect. If any of the requests in this example encounter a 500
            error code, the policy at UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy
            takes effect. When used in conjunction with
            pathMatcher.defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence.
            Only once all retries are exhausted, the
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a
            retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from
            the service is returned to the client.
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for Global
            External HTTP(S) load balancing.

            The target value of the metric that autoscaler maintains. This must
            be a positive value. A utilization metric scales number of virtual
            machines handling requests to increase or decrease proportionally to
            the metric. For example, a good metric to use as a
            utilization_target is
            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/instance/network/received_bytes_count.
            The autoscaler works to keep this value constant for each of the

            an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled group.
            Autoscaler keeps the number of instances proportional to the value
            of this metric. The metric itself does not change value due to group
            resizing. A good metric to use with the target is for example
            pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages or a
            custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to your
            instances. A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or
            median latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to
            a single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target
            instead.
        metric:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The identifier (type) of the Stackdriver Monitoring metric. The

          description: >-
            A filter string, compatible with a Stackdriver Monitoring filter
            string for TimeSeries.list API call. This filter is used to select a
            specific TimeSeries for the purpose of autoscaling and to determine
            whether the metric is exporting per-instance or per-group data. For
            the filter to be valid for autoscaling purposes, the following rules
            apply: - You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors. -
            You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without any
            functions for each selector. - You can specify the metric in both
            the filter string and in the metric field. However, if specified in
            both places, the metric must be identical. - The monitored resource
            type determines what kind of values are expected for the metric. If
            it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to include a
            separate TimeSeries for each instance in a group. In such a case,
            you cannot filter on resource labels. If the resource type is any
            other value, the autoscaler expects this metric to contain values
            that apply to the entire autoscaled instance group and resource
            label filtering can be performed to point autoscaler at the correct
            TimeSeries to scale upon. This is called a *per-group metric* for
            the purpose of autoscaling. If not specified, the type defaults to
            gce_instance. Try to provide a filter that is selective enough to
            pick just one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the
            instances (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
            TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
            will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.

            specify a max-stale directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL
            configured here will not be served. The default limit (max-stale) is

            When there is a match, the relevant configuration is made available
            to those proxies. Otherwise, all the resources (e.g.
            TargetHttpProxy, UrlMap) referenced by the ForwardingRule are not
            visible to those proxies. For each metadataFilter in this list, if
            its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ANY, at least one of the
            filterLabels must match the corresponding label provided in the
            metadata. If its filterMatchCriteria is set to MATCH_ALL, then all

            client sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs
            the traffic to the referenced target or backendService. While
            creating a forwarding rule, specifying an IPAddress is required
            under the following circumstances: - When the target is set to
            targetGrpcProxy and validateForProxyless is set to true, the
            IPAddress should be set to 0.0.0.0. - When the target is a Private
            Service Connect Google APIs bundle, you must specify an IPAddress.
            Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references
            an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted,
            Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the
            following formats to specify an IP address while creating a
            forwarding rule: * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3` * IPv6
            address range, as in `2600:1234::/96` * Full resource URL, as in
            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/
            project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL or by
            name, as in: -
            projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name -
            regions/region/addresses/address-name -
            global/addresses/address-name - address-name The forwarding rule's
            target or backendService, and in most cases, also the
            loadBalancingScheme, determine the type of IP address that you can
            use. For detailed information, see [IP address
            specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
            When reading an IPAddress, the API always returns the IP address

        defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy:
          description: >-
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer
            returns error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds
            with an error. This policy takes effect at the Load Balancer level
            and applies only when no policy has been defined for the error code
            at lower levels like PathMatcher, RouteRule and PathRule within this
            UrlMap. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following
            configuration: - defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy containing
            policies for responding to 5xx and 4xx errors - A PathMatcher
            configured for *.example.com has defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy
            for 4xx. If a request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 404,
            the policy in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be
            enforced. When the request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a
            502, the policy in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be
            enforced. When a request that does not match any host in
            *.example.com such as http://www.myotherexample.com/, encounters a
            404, UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When used
            in conjunction with defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take
            precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a
            retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from
            the service is returned to the client.
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for Global

            The load balancer performs advanced routing actions, such as URL
            rewrites and header transformations, before forwarding the request
            to the selected backend. If defaultRouteAction specifies any

            *end-of-stream*), the duration in this field is computed from the
            beginning of the stream until the response has been processed,
            including all retries. A stream that does not complete in this
            duration is closed. If not specified, this field uses the maximum
            maxStreamDuration value among all backend services associated with
            the route. This field is only allowed if the Url map is used with
            backend services with loadBalancingScheme set to
            INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED.
        faultInjectionPolicy:
          description: >-
            The specification for fault injection introduced into traffic to
            test the resiliency of clients to backend service failure. As part
            of fault injection, when clients send requests to a backend service,
            delays can be introduced by a load balancer on a percentage of
            requests before sending those requests to the backend service.
            Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the load balancer
            for a percentage of requests. timeout and retry_policy is ignored by
            clients that are configured with a fault_injection_policy if: 1. The
            traffic is generated by fault injection AND 2. The fault injection
            is not a delay fault injection. Fault injection is not supported
            with the global external HTTP(S) load balancer (classic). To see
            which load balancers support fault injection, see Load balancing:
            Routing and traffic management features.

            A list of weighted backend services to send traffic to when a route

            flows to their corresponding backend service. If all traffic needs
            to go to a single backend service, there must be one
            weightedBackendService with weight set to a non-zero number. After a
            backend service is identified and before forwarding the request to
            the backend service, advanced routing actions such as URL rewrites
            and header transformations are applied depending on additional

    Policy:
      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
        **JSON example:** { "bindings": [ { "role":

            Optionally, may specify a `condition` that determines how and when
            the `bindings` are applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at
            least one principal. The `bindings` in a `Policy` can refer to up to
            1,500 principals; up to 250 of these principals can be Google
            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to
            `user:alice@example.com`, and not to any other principal, then you
            can add another 1,450 principals to the `bindings` in the `Policy`.

            Specifies the format of the policy. Valid values are `0`, `1`, and
            `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected. Any
            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
            documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).
        etag:
          description: >-
            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

            maxResults, use the nextPageToken as a value for the query parameter
            pageToken in the next list request. Subsequent list requests will
            have their own nextPageToken to continue paging through the results.

            backends only for connection-oriented protocols (TCP and SCTP) and
            only if the Tracking Mode is PER_CONNECTION (default tracking mode)
            or the Session Affinity is configured for 5-tuple. They do not
            persist for UDP. If set to NEVER_PERSIST, after a backend becomes
            unhealthy, the existing connections on the unhealthy backend are
            never persisted on the unhealthy backend. They are always diverted
            to newly selected healthy backends (unless all backends are
            unhealthy). If set to ALWAYS_PERSIST, existing connections always
            persist on unhealthy backends regardless of protocol and session
            affinity. It is generally not recommended to use this mode
            overriding the default. For more details, see [Connection

          description: >-
            Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to
            apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can
            reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by
            reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to
            CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to
            responses with the specified response code that lack any
            Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the
            cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to
            all responses with the specified response code, and override any
            caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will apply the following
            default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301,
            308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451
            (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found),
            421 (Misdirected Request), 501 (Not Implemented): 60s. These

            client_ttl clamps the max-age from the origin (if specified), or
            else sets the response max-age directive to the lesser of the
            client_ttl and default_ttl, and also ensures a "public"
            cache-control directive is present. If a client TTL is not

            default "max-stale" duration for any cached responses that do not
            specify a max-stale directive. Stale responses that exceed the TTL
            configured here will not be served. The default limit (max-stale) is

        Returns the specified Project resource. To decrease latency for this
        method, you can optionally omit any unneeded information from the
        response by using a field mask. This practice is especially recommended
        for unused quota information (the `quotas` field). To exclude one or
        more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter to only include
        the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id` and
        `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to your
        request.

        This method suspends a running instance, saving its state to persistent

        Suspended instances have no compute costs (cores or RAM), and incur only
        storage charges for the saved VM memory and localSSD data. Any charged
        resources the virtual machine was using, such as persistent disks and

        Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE` or for
        the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
        specified Operation resource. This method differs from the `GET` method
        in that it waits for no more than the default deadline (2 minutes) and
        then returns the current state of the operation, which might be `DONE`
        or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort basis.
        Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the
        request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might
        return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached, there
        is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method
        returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`.

        Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE` or for
        the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
        specified Operation resource. This method differs from the `GET` method
        in that it waits for no more than the default deadline (2 minutes) and
        then returns the current state of the operation, which might be `DONE`
        or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort basis.
        Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the
        request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might
        return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached, there
        is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method
        returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`.

        instances have not yet been removed from the group. You must separately
        verify the status of the abandoning action with the listmanagedinstances
        method. If the group is part of a backend service that has enabled
        connection draining, it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection
        draining duration has elapsed before the VM instance is removed or

        per request.

        Flags the specified instances in the managed instance group to be
        resumed. This method increases the targetSize and decreases the
        targetSuspendedSize of the managed instance group by the number of
        instances that you resume. The resumeInstances operation is marked DONE
        if the resumeInstances request is successful. The underlying actions
        take additional time. You must separately verify the status of the
        RESUMING action with the listmanagedinstances method. In this request,
        you can only specify instances that are suspended. For example, if an
        instance was previously suspended using the suspendInstances method, it
        can be resumed using the resumeInstances method. If a health check is
        attached to the managed instance group, the specified instances will be
        verified as healthy after they are resumed. You can specify a maximum of
        1000 instances with this method per request.

        Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE` or for
        the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
        specified Operation resource. This method waits for no more than the 2
        minutes and then returns the current state of the operation, which might
        be `DONE` or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort
        basis. Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded,
        the request might return before the default deadline is reached, or
        might return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached,
        there is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the
        method returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`.
