            delays can be introduced by a load balancer on a percentage of
            requests before sending those requests to the backend service.
            Similarly requests from clients can be aborted by the load balancer

            factors. We recommend that you test how long your application takes

        defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/CustomErrorResponsePolicy'
          description: >-
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer
            returns error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds
            with an error. This policy takes effect at the PathMatcher level and
            applies only when no policy has been defined for the error code at
            lower levels like RouteRule and PathRule within this PathMatcher. If
            an error code does not have a policy defined in
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, then a policy defined for the
            error code in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect.
            For example, consider a UrlMap with the following configuration: -
            UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is configured with policies
            for 5xx and 4xx errors - A RouteRule for /coming_soon/ is configured
            for the error code 404. If the request is for www.myotherdomain.com
            and a 404 is encountered, the policy under
            UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If a 404
            response is encountered for the request
            www.example.com/current_events/, the pathMatcher's policy takes
            effect. If however, the request for www.example.com/coming_soon/
            encounters a 404, the policy in RouteRule.customErrorResponsePolicy
            takes effect. If any of the requests in this example encounter a 500
            error code, the policy at UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy
            takes effect. When used in conjunction with
            pathMatcher.defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence.
            Only once all retries are exhausted, the
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a
            retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from
            the service is returned to the client.
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for Global
            External HTTP(S) load balancing.

            URLs to a BackendService resource: -
            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/project
            /global/backendServices/backendService -
            compute/v1/projects/project/global/backendServices/backendService -
            global/backendServices/backendService If defaultRouteAction is also
            specified, advanced routing actions, such as URL rewrites, take
            effect before sending the request to the backend. However, if
            defaultService is specified, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any
            weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if defaultRouteAction specifies
            any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be specified.
            Only one of defaultService, defaultUrlRedirect , or
            defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be set. Authorization

            balancer. - MAGLEV: used as a drop in replacement for the ring hash

              For network endpoint group backends, the health check uses the
              port number specified on each endpoint in the network endpoint
              group. For instance group backends, the health check uses the port

            backend services for pass-through load balancers and backend
            services for proxy load balancers. Not supported by target pools.
            The health check supports all backends supported by the backend
            service provided the backend can be health checked. For example,
            GCE_VM_IP network endpoint groups, GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint
            groups, and instance group backends. USE_NAMED_PORT: Not supported.
            USE_SERVING_PORT: Provides an indirect method of specifying the
            health check port by referring to the backend service. Only

            pass-through load balancers. Supports all backends that can be
            health checked; for example, GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint groups
            and instance group backends. For GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint
            group backends, the health check uses the port number specified for
            each endpoint in the network endpoint group. For instance group
            backends, the health check uses the port number determined by

            The priority of a rule decreases as its number increases (1, 2, 3,
            N+1). The first rule that matches the request is applied. You cannot
            configure two or more routeRules with the same priority. Priority
            for each rule must be set to a number from 0 to 2147483647
            inclusive. Priority numbers can have gaps, which enable you to add
            or remove rules in the future without affecting the rest of the
            rules. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 12, 16 is a valid series of

            backend. If routeAction specifies any weightedBackendServices,
            service must not be set. Conversely if service is set, routeAction
            cannot contain any weightedBackendServices. Only one of urlRedirect,
            service or routeAction.weightedBackendService must be set. URL maps

            customErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer returns
            error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds with an
            error. If a policy for an error code is not configured for the
            RouteRule, a policy for the error code configured in
            pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. If one is
            not specified in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy, the
            policy configured in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes
            effect. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following
            configuration: - UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy are
            configured with policies for 5xx and 4xx errors - A RouteRule for
            /coming_soon/ is configured for the error code 404. If the request
            is for www.myotherdomain.com and a 404 is encountered, the policy
            under UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. If a 404
            response is encountered for the request
            www.example.com/current_events/, the pathMatcher's policy takes
            effect. If however, the request for www.example.com/coming_soon/
            encounters a 404, the policy in RouteRule.customErrorResponsePolicy
            takes effect. If any of the requests in this example encounter a 500
            error code, the policy at UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy
            takes effect. When used in conjunction with
            routeRules.routeAction.retryPolicy, retries take precedence. Only
            once all retries are exhausted, the customErrorResponsePolicy is
            applied. While attempting a retry, if load balancer is successful in
            reaching the service, the customErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and
            the response from the service is returned to the client.
            customErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for Global External
            HTTP(S) load balancing.

              Subsetting based on consistent hashing. For Traffic Director, the
              number of backends per backend group (the subset size) is based on
              the `subset_size` parameter. For Internal HTTP(S) load balancing,
              the number of backends per backend group (the subset size) is
              dynamically adjusted in two cases: - As the number of proxy
              instances participating in Internal HTTP(S) load balancing
              increases, the subset size decreases. - When the total number of
              backends in a network exceeds the capacity of a single proxy
              instance, subset sizes are reduced automatically for each service
              that has backend subsetting enabled.
            - >-
              No Subsetting. Clients may open connections and send traffic to
              all backends of this backend service. This can lead to performance
              issues if there is substantial imbalance in the count of clients
              and backends.

            is set to `CONSISTENT_HASH_SUBSETTING`. Can only be set if load
            balancing scheme is `INTERNAL_MANAGED` or `INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED`.
            `subset_size` is optional for Internal HTTP(S) load balancing and
            required for Traffic Director. If you do not provide this value,
            Cloud Load Balancing will calculate it dynamically to optimize the
            number of proxies/clients visible to each backend and vice versa.
            Must be greater than 0. If `subset_size` is larger than the number
            of backends/endpoints, then subsetting is disabled.

            connecting to the instance or endpoint. For example, connection
            timeouts. - retriable-4xx: a retry is attempted if the instance or
            endpoint responds with a 4xx response code. The only error that you
            can retry is error code 409. - refused-stream: a retry is attempted
            if the instance or endpoint resets the stream with a REFUSED_STREAM
            error code. This reset type indicates that it is safe to retry. -
            cancelled: a retry is attempted if the gRPC status code in the

            attempted if the gRPC status code in the response header is set to

            A match condition that incoming packets are evaluated against for
            CLOUD_ARMOR_NETWORK security policies. If it matches, the
            corresponding 'action' is enforced. The match criteria for a rule
            consists of built-in match fields (like 'srcIpRanges') and
            potentially multiple user-defined match fields
            ('userDefinedFields'). Field values may be extracted directly from
            the packet or derived from it (e.g. 'srcRegionCodes'). Some fields
            may not be present in every packet (e.g. 'srcPorts'). A user-defined
            field is only present if the base header is found in the packet and
            the entire field is in bounds. Each match field may specify which
            values can match it, listing one or more ranges, prefixes, or exact
            values that are considered a match for the field. A field value must
            be present in order to match a specified match field. If no match
            values are specified for a match field, then any field value is
            considered to match it, and it's not required to be present. For
            strings specifying '*' is also equivalent to match all. For a packet
            to match a rule, all specified match fields must match the
            corresponding field values derived from the packet. Example:
            networkMatch: srcIpRanges: - "192.0.2.0/24" - "198.51.100.0/24"
            userDefinedFields: - name: "ipv4_fragment_offset" values: -
            "1-0x1fff" The above match condition matches packets with a source
            IP in 192.0.2.0/24 or 198.51.100.0/24 and a user-defined field named
            "ipv4_fragment_offset" with a value between 1 and 0x1fff inclusive.

            incompatible with their cloud provider. Specifically, when ordering
            a redundant pair of Cross-Cloud Interconnect ports, and one of them
            uses a remote location with portPairMatchingRemoteLocation set to
            matching, the UI requires that both ports use the same remote

    Policy:
      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

            groups. Each occurrence of a principal counts towards these limits.
            For example, if the `bindings` grant 50 different roles to

            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each

            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of

            operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify
            version `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations: *
            Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a
            conditional role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role
            binding in a policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a
            condition, from a policy that includes conditions **Important:** If
            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all

            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may

        On failover or failback, this field indicates whether connection
        draining will be honored. Google Cloud has a fixed connection draining
        timeout of 10 minutes. A setting of true terminates existing TCP
        connections to the active pool during failover and failback, immediately
        draining traffic. A setting of false allows existing TCP connections to
        persist, even on VMs no longer in the active pool, for up to the
        duration of the connection draining timeout (10 minutes).

            backend services for pass-through load balancers and backend
            services for proxy load balancers. Not supported by target pools.
            The health check supports all backends supported by the backend

            Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to
            apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects. This can
            reduce the load on your origin and improve end-user experience by
            reducing response latency. When the cache mode is set to
            CACHE_ALL_STATIC or USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, negative caching applies to
            responses with the specified response code that lack any
            Cache-Control, Expires, or Pragma: no-cache directives. When the
            cache mode is set to FORCE_CACHE_ALL, negative caching applies to
            all responses with the specified response code, and override any
            caching headers. By default, Cloud CDN will apply the following
            default TTLs to these status codes: HTTP 300 (Multiple Choice), 301,
            308 (Permanent Redirects): 10m HTTP 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone), 451
            (Unavailable For Legal Reasons): 120s HTTP 405 (Method Not Found),

            explicitly using the port field in the health check. Supported by
            backend services for pass-through load balancers and backend
            services for proxy load balancers. Not supported by target pools.
            The health check supports all backends supported by the backend
            service provided the backend can be health checked. For example,
            GCE_VM_IP network endpoint groups, GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint
            groups, and instance group backends. USE_NAMED_PORT: Not supported.
            USE_SERVING_PORT: Provides an indirect method of specifying the
            health check port by referring to the backend service. Only

        [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/regionTargetHttpsProxies) A
        target HTTPS proxy is a component of GCP HTTPS load balancers. *
        targetHttpsProxies are used by external HTTPS load balancers. *
        regionTargetHttpsProxies are used by internal HTTPS load balancers.
        Forwarding rules reference a target HTTPS proxy, and the target proxy
        then references a URL map. For more information, read Using Target
        Proxies and Forwarding rule concepts.

        resource means that you are purchasing a committed use contract with an
        explicit start and end time. You can create commitments based on vCPUs
        and memory usage and receive discounted rates. For full details, read

            must be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and
            sourceTags may be set. If both fields are set, the rule applies to
            traffic that has a source IP address within sourceRanges OR a source
            IP from a resource with a matching tag listed in the sourceTags
            field. The connection does not need to match both fields for the

            instance with service account listed in sourceServiceAccount. The
            connection does not need to match both fields for the firewall to

              The port number in the health check's port is used for health
              checking. Applies to network endpoint group and instance group
              backends.
            - Not supported.
            - >-
              For network endpoint group backends, the health check uses the
              port number specified on each endpoint in the network endpoint
              group. For instance group backends, the health check uses the port
              number specified for the backend service's named port defined in
              the instance group's named ports.
          description: >-
            Specifies how a port is selected for health checking. Can be one of
            the following values: USE_FIXED_PORT: Specifies a port number
            explicitly using the port field in the health check. Supported by
            backend services for pass-through load balancers and backend
            services for proxy load balancers. Not supported by target pools.
            The health check supports all backends supported by the backend
            service provided the backend can be health checked. For example,
            GCE_VM_IP network endpoint groups, GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint
            groups, and instance group backends. USE_NAMED_PORT: Not supported.
            USE_SERVING_PORT: Provides an indirect method of specifying the
            health check port by referring to the backend service. Only
            supported by backend services for proxy load balancers. Not
            supported by target pools. Not supported by backend services for
            pass-through load balancers. Supports all backends that can be
            health checked; for example, GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint groups
            and instance group backends. For GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint
            group backends, the health check uses the port number specified for
            each endpoint in the network endpoint group. For instance group
            backends, the health check uses the port number determined by
            looking up the backend service's named port in the instance group's
            list of named ports.

            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy specifies how the Load Balancer
            returns error responses when BackendServiceor BackendBucket responds
            with an error. This policy takes effect at the Load Balancer level
            and applies only when no policy has been defined for the error code
            at lower levels like PathMatcher, RouteRule and PathRule within this
            UrlMap. For example, consider a UrlMap with the following
            configuration: - defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy containing
            policies for responding to 5xx and 4xx errors - A PathMatcher
            configured for *.example.com has defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy
            for 4xx. If a request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a 404,
            the policy in pathMatcher.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be
            enforced. When the request for http://www.example.com/ encounters a
            502, the policy in UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy will be
            enforced. When a request that does not match any host in
            *.example.com such as http://www.myotherexample.com/, encounters a
            404, UrlMap.defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy takes effect. When used
            in conjunction with defaultRouteAction.retryPolicy, retries take
            precedence. Only once all retries are exhausted, the
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is applied. While attempting a
            retry, if load balancer is successful in reaching the service, the
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is ignored and the response from
            the service is returned to the client.
            defaultCustomErrorResponsePolicy is supported only for Global

        IPAddress:
          description: >-
            IP address for which this forwarding rule accepts traffic. When a
            client sends traffic to this IP address, the forwarding rule directs
            the traffic to the referenced target or backendService. While
            creating a forwarding rule, specifying an IPAddress is required
            under the following circumstances: - When the target is set to
            targetGrpcProxy and validateForProxyless is set to true, the
            IPAddress should be set to 0.0.0.0. - When the target is a Private
            Service Connect Google APIs bundle, you must specify an IPAddress.
            Otherwise, you can optionally specify an IP address that references
            an existing static (reserved) IP address resource. When omitted,
            Google Cloud assigns an ephemeral IP address. Use one of the
            following formats to specify an IP address while creating a
            forwarding rule: * IP address number, as in `100.1.2.3` * IPv6
            address range, as in `2600:1234::/96` * Full resource URL, as in
            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/
            project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name * Partial URL or by
            name, as in: -
            projects/project_id/regions/region/addresses/address-name -
            regions/region/addresses/address-name -
            global/addresses/address-name - address-name The forwarding rule's
            target or backendService, and in most cases, also the
            loadBalancingScheme, determine the type of IP address that you can
            use. For detailed information, see [IP address
            specifications](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/forwarding-rule-concepts#ip_address_specifications).
            When reading an IPAddress, the API always returns the IP address
            number.

              For network endpoint group backends, the health check uses the
              port number specified on each endpoint in the network endpoint
              group. For instance group backends, the health check uses the port
              number specified for the backend service's named port defined in
              the instance group's named ports.
          description: >-
            Specifies how a port is selected for health checking. Can be one of
            the following values: USE_FIXED_PORT: Specifies a port number
            explicitly using the port field in the health check. Supported by
            backend services for pass-through load balancers and backend
            services for proxy load balancers. Not supported by target pools.
            The health check supports all backends supported by the backend
            service provided the backend can be health checked. For example,
            GCE_VM_IP network endpoint groups, GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint
            groups, and instance group backends. USE_NAMED_PORT: Not supported.
            USE_SERVING_PORT: Provides an indirect method of specifying the
            health check port by referring to the backend service. Only
            supported by backend services for proxy load balancers. Not
            supported by target pools. Not supported by backend services for
            pass-through load balancers. Supports all backends that can be
            health checked; for example, GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint groups
            and instance group backends. For GCE_VM_IP_PORT network endpoint
            group backends, the health check uses the port number specified for
            each endpoint in the network endpoint group. For instance group
            backends, the health check uses the port number determined by
            looking up the backend service's named port in the instance group's
            list of named ports.

          description: >-
            A filter string, compatible with a Stackdriver Monitoring filter
            string for TimeSeries.list API call. This filter is used to select a
            specific TimeSeries for the purpose of autoscaling and to determine
            whether the metric is exporting per-instance or per-group data. For
            the filter to be valid for autoscaling purposes, the following rules
            apply: - You can only use the AND operator for joining selectors. -
            You can only use direct equality comparison operator (=) without any
            functions for each selector. - You can specify the metric in both
            the filter string and in the metric field. However, if specified in
            both places, the metric must be identical. - The monitored resource
            type determines what kind of values are expected for the metric. If
            it is a gce_instance, the autoscaler expects the metric to include a
            separate TimeSeries for each instance in a group. In such a case,
            you cannot filter on resource labels. If the resource type is any
            other value, the autoscaler expects this metric to contain values
            that apply to the entire autoscaled instance group and resource
            label filtering can be performed to point autoscaler at the correct
            TimeSeries to scale upon. This is called a *per-group metric* for
            the purpose of autoscaling. If not specified, the type defaults to
            gce_instance. Try to provide a filter that is selective enough to
            pick just one TimeSeries for the autoscaled group or for each of the
            instances (if you are using gce_instance resource type). If multiple
            TimeSeries are returned upon the query execution, the autoscaler
            will sum their respective values to obtain its scaling value.

            The target value of the metric that autoscaler maintains. This must

            machines handling requests to increase or decrease proportionally to
            the metric. For example, a good metric to use as a
            utilization_target is
            https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/instance/network/received_bytes_count.

        singleInstanceAssignment:

          description: >-
            If scaling is based on a per-group metric value that represents the

            an amount assigned for a single instance of the scaled group.
            Autoscaler keeps the number of instances proportional to the value
            of this metric. The metric itself does not change value due to group
            resizing. A good metric to use with the target is for example
            pubsub.googleapis.com/subscription/num_undelivered_messages or a
            custom metric exporting the total number of requests coming to your
            instances. A bad example would be a metric exporting an average or
            median latency, since this value can't include a chunk assignable to
            a single instance, it could be better used with utilization_target
            instead.

        version the VM is based on. + For regional managed instance groups, the
        location of the VM instance. This list is subject to change. If the
        group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining,
        it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has
        elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

        Resizes the managed instance group with advanced configuration options
        like disabling creation retries. This is an extended version of the
        resize method. If you increase the size of the instance group, the group
        creates new instances using the current instance template. If you
        decrease the size, the group deletes instances. The resize operation is
        marked DONE when the resize actions are scheduled even if the group has
        not yet added or deleted any instances. You must separately verify the
        status of the creating, creatingWithoutRetries, or deleting actions with
        the get or listmanagedinstances method. If the group is part of a
        backend service that has enabled connection draining, it can take up to
        60 seconds after the connection draining duration has elapsed before the
        VM instance is removed or deleted.

        This method suspends a running instance, saving its state to persistent

        Suspended instances have no compute costs (cores or RAM), and incur only
        storage charges for the saved VM memory and localSSD data. Any charged
        resources the virtual machine was using, such as persistent disks and
        static IP addresses, will continue to be charged while the instance is

        Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE` or for
        the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
        specified Operation resource. This method differs from the `GET` method
        in that it waits for no more than the default deadline (2 minutes) and
        then returns the current state of the operation, which might be `DONE`
        or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort basis.
        Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the
        request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might
        return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached, there
        is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method
        returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`.

        Resizes the regional managed instance group with advanced configuration
        options like disabling creation retries. This is an extended version of
        the resize method. If you increase the size, the group creates new
        instances using the current instance template. If you decrease the size,
        the group deletes one or more instances. The resize operation is marked
        DONE if the resize request is successful. The underlying actions take
        additional time. You must separately verify the status of the creating
        or deleting actions with the get or listmanagedinstances method. If the
        group is part of a backend service that has enabled connection draining,
        it can take up to 60 seconds after the connection draining duration has
        elapsed before the VM instance is removed or deleted.

        Returns the specified Project resource. To decrease latency for this

        response by using a field mask. This practice is especially recommended
        for unused quota information (the `quotas` field). To exclude one or
        more fields, set your request's `fields` query parameter to only include
        the fields you need. For example, to only include the `id` and
        `selfLink` fields, add the query parameter `?fields=id,selfLink` to your
        request.

        Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE` or for
        the request to approach the 2 minute deadline, and retrieves the
        specified Operation resource. This method differs from the `GET` method
        in that it waits for no more than the default deadline (2 minutes) and
        then returns the current state of the operation, which might be `DONE`
        or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort basis.
        Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded, the
        request might return before the default deadline is reached, or might
        return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached, there
        is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the method
        returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`.

        Waits for the specified Operation resource to return as `DONE` or for

        minutes and then returns the current state of the operation, which might
        be `DONE` or still in progress. This method is called on a best-effort
        basis. Specifically: - In uncommon cases, when the server is overloaded,
        the request might return before the default deadline is reached, or
        might return after zero seconds. - If the default deadline is reached,
        there is no guarantee that the operation is actually done when the
        method returns. Be prepared to retry if the operation is not `DONE`.
