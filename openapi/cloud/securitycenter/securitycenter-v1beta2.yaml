              Vulnerability: A critical vulnerability is easily discoverable by
              an external actor, exploitable, and results in the direct ability
              to execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain
              additional access and privileges to cloud resources and workloads.
              Examples include publicly accessible unprotected user data and
              public SSH access with weak or no passwords. Threat: Indicates a
              threat that is able to access, modify, or delete data or execute
              unauthorized code within existing resources.
            - >-
              Vulnerability: A high risk vulnerability can be easily discovered
              and exploited in combination with other vulnerabilities in order
              to gain direct access and the ability to execute arbitrary code,
              exfiltrate data, and otherwise gain additional access and
              privileges to cloud resources and workloads. An example is a
              database with weak or no passwords that is only accessible
              internally. This database could easily be compromised by an actor
              that had access to the internal network. Threat: Indicates a
              threat that is able to create new computational resources in an
              environment but not able to access data or execute code in
              existing resources.
            - >-
              Vulnerability: A medium risk vulnerability could be used by an
              actor to gain access to resources or privileges that enable them
              to eventually (through multiple steps or a complex exploit) gain
              access and the ability to execute arbitrary code or exfiltrate
              data. An example is a service account with access to more projects
              than it should have. If an actor gains access to the service
              account, they could potentially use that access to manipulate a
              project the service account was not intended to. Threat: Indicates
              a threat that is able to cause operational impact but may not
              access data or execute unauthorized code.
            - >-
              Vulnerability: A low risk vulnerability hampers a security
              organization's ability to detect vulnerabilities or active threats
              in their deployment, or prevents the root cause investigation of
              security issues. An example is monitoring and logs being disabled
              for resource configurations and access. Threat: Indicates a threat
              that has obtained minimal access to an environment but is not able
              to access data, execute code, or create resources.

            supports principals that aren't associated with email addresses,
            such as third party principals. For most identities, the format is
            `principal://iam.googleapis.com/{identity pool
            name}/subject/{subject}`. Some GKE identities, such as GKE_WORKLOAD,

            callers, the `principal_subject` field is populated instead of this
            field. For privacy reasons, the principal email address is sometimes

              system to carry out an attack.

        Get the ContainerThreatDetectionSettings resource. In the returned
        settings response, a missing field only indicates that it was not
        explicitly set, so no assumption should be made about these fields. In
        other words, GetContainerThreatDetectionSettings does not calculate the
        effective service settings for the resource, which accounts for
        inherited settings and defaults. Instead, use
        CalculateContainerThreatDetectionSettings for this purpose.
