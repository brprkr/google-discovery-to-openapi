        have an effect on traffic currently being routed to other existing
        deployments. 2) To warn users if some base path in the proxy will not
        receive traffic due to an existing deployment having already claimed
        that base path. The presence of routing conflicts/changes will not cause
        non-dry-run DeployApiProxy/UndeployApiProxy requests to be rejected.

            For example, when you call

              Too Many Requests
            - >-
              The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state
              required for the operation's execution. For example, the directory
              to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a
              non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following
              guidelines to decide between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, `ABORTED`, and
              `UNAVAILABLE`: (a) Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just
              the failing call. (b) Use `ABORTED` if the client should retry at
              a higher level. For example, when a client-specified test-and-set
              fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write
              sequence. (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not
              retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. For
              example, if an "rmdir" fails because the directory is non-empty,
              `FAILED_PRECONDITION` should be returned since the client should
              not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory. HTTP
              Mapping: 400 Bad Request
            - >-
              The operation was aborted, typically due to a concurrency issue
              such as a sequencer check failure or transaction abort. See the
              guidelines above for deciding between `FAILED_PRECONDITION`,
              `ABORTED`, and `UNAVAILABLE`. HTTP Mapping: 409 Conflict
            - >-
              The operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or
              reading past end-of-file. Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error
              indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes.
              For example, a 32-bit file system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
              if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1],
              but it will generate `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an
              offset past the current file size. There is a fair bit of overlap
              between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `OUT_OF_RANGE`. We recommend
              using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific error) when it applies so
              that callers who are iterating through a space can easily look for
              an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when they are done. HTTP

    GoogleApiHttpBody:
      description: >-
        Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used
        for payload formats that can't be represented as JSON, such as raw
        binary or an HTML page. This message can be used both in streaming and
        non-streaming API methods in the request as well as the response. It can
        be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one wants
        to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
        request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body. Example:
        message GetResourceRequest { // A unique request id. string request_id =
        1; // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field. google.api.HttpBody
        http_body = 2; } service ResourceService { rpc
        GetResource(GetResourceRequest) returns (google.api.HttpBody); rpc
        UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody) returns (google.protobuf.Empty); }
        Example with streaming methods: service CaldavService { rpc
        GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody) returns (stream
        google.api.HttpBody); rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
        returns (stream google.api.HttpBody); } Use of this type only changes
        how the request and response bodies are handled, all other features will
        continue to work unchanged.

            developers from accessing those resources through API proxies
            deployed in another environment. This setting is used, for example,

            Comma-separated list of API resources to be bundled in the API
            product. By default, the resource paths are mapped from the
            `proxy.pathsuffix` variable. The proxy path suffix is defined as the
            URI fragment following the ProxyEndpoint base path. For example, if
            the `apiResources` element is defined to be `/forecastrss` and the
            base path defined for the API proxy is `/weather`, then only
            requests to `/weather/forecastrss` are permitted by the API product.
            You can select a specific path, or you can select all subpaths with
            the following wildcard: - `/**`: Indicates that all sub-URIs are
            included. - `/*` : Indicates that only URIs one level down are
            included. By default, / supports the same resources as /** as well
            as the base path defined by the API proxy. For example, if the base
            path of the API proxy is `/v1/weatherapikey`, then the API product
            supports requests to `/v1/weatherapikey` and to any sub-URIs, such
            as `/v1/weatherapikey/forecastrss`, `/v1/weatherapikey/region/CA`,
            and so on. For more information, see Managing API products.

            you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever
            you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you
            to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all
            of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost. If a policy
            does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may
            specify any valid version or leave the field unset. To learn which
            resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
            documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each
            other. It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag`
            in the read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to
            avoid race conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to
            `getIamPolicy`, and systems are expected to put that etag in the
            request to `setIamPolicy` to ensure that their change will be
            applied to the same version of the policy. **Important:** If you use
            IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
            `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to
            overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of
            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.

        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access
        controls for Google Cloud resources. A `Policy` is a collection of
        `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more `members`, or principals, to a
        single `role`. Principals can be user accounts, service accounts, Google
        groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of
        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created
        custom role. For some types of Google Cloud resources, a `binding` can
        also specify a `condition`, which is a logical expression that allows
        access to a resource only if the expression evaluates to `true`. A
        condition can add constraints based on attributes of the request, the
        resource, or both. To learn which resources support conditions in their
        IAM policies, see the [IAM
        documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies).

        Creates a Custom Report for an Organization. A Custom Report provides
        Apigee Customers to create custom dashboards in addition to the standard
        dashboards which are provided. The Custom Report in its simplest form
        contains specifications about metrics, dimensions and filters. It is
        important to note that the custom report by itself does not provide an
        executable entity. The Edge UI converts the custom report definition
        into an analytics query and displays the result in a chart.

        Creates a custom consumer key and secret for a developer app. This is

        consumer key and secret, an association to API products will not be

        key and secret already exist, you can keep them or delete them using the
        DeleteDeveloperAppKey API.

        Manages access to a developer app by enabling you to: * Approve or
        revoke a developer app * Generate a new consumer key and secret for a
        developer app To approve or revoke a developer app, set the `action`
        query parameter to `approve` or `revoke`, respectively, and the
        `Content-Type` header to `application/octet-stream`. If a developer app
        is revoked, none of its API keys are valid for API calls even though the
        keys are still approved. If successful, the API call returns the
        following HTTP status code: `204 No Content` To generate a new consumer
        key and secret for a developer app, pass the new key/secret details.
        Rather than replace an existing key, this API generates a new key. In
        this case, multiple key pairs may be associated with a single developer
        app. Each key pair has an independent status (`approve` or `revoke`) and
        expiration time. Any approved, non-expired key can be used in an API
        call. For example, if you're using API key rotation, you can generate
        new keys with expiration times that overlap keys that are going to
        expire. You might also generate a new consumer key/secret if the
        security of the original key/secret is compromised. The `keyExpiresIn`
        property defines the expiration time for the API key in milliseconds. If
        you don't set this property or set it to `-1`, the API key never
        expires. **Notes**: * When generating a new key/secret, this API
        replaces the existing attributes, notes, and callback URLs with those
        specified in the request. Include or exclude any existing information
        that you want to retain or delete, respectively. * To migrate existing
        consumer keys and secrets to hybrid from another system, see the
        CreateDeveloperAppKey API.

        Sets the status of a developer. A developer is `active` by default. If
        you set a developer's status to `inactive`, the API keys assigned to the
        developer apps are no longer valid even though the API keys are set to
        `approved`. Inactive developers can still sign in to the developer
        portal and create apps; however, any new API keys generated during app
        creation won't work. To set the status of a developer, set the `action`
        query parameter to `active` or `inactive`, and the `Content-Type` header
        to `application/octet-stream`. If successful, the API call returns the
        following HTTP status code: `204 No Content`

        Creates an API product in an organization. You create API products after
        you have proxied backend services using API proxies. An API product is a
        collection of API resources combined with quota settings and metadata
        that you can use to deliver customized and productized API bundles to
        your developer community. This metadata can include: - Scope -
        Environments - API proxies - Extensible profile API products enable you
        repackage APIs on the fly, without having to do any additional coding or
        configuration. Apigee recommends that you start with a simple API
        product including only required elements. You then provision credentials
        to apps to enable them to start testing your APIs. After you have
        authentication and authorization working against a simple API product,
        you can iterate to create finer-grained API products, defining different
        sets of API resources for each API product. **WARNING:** - If you don't
        specify an API proxy in the request body, *any* app associated with the
        product can make calls to *any* API in your entire organization. - If
        you don't specify an environment in the request body, the product allows
        access to all environments. For more information, see What is an API
        product?

        Create a rate plan that is associated with an API product in an
        organization. Using rate plans, API product owners can monetize their
        API products by configuring one or more of the following: - Billing
        frequency - Initial setup fees for using an API product - Payment
        funding model (postpaid only) - Fixed recurring or consumption-based
        charges for using an API product - Revenue sharing with developer
        partners An API product can have multiple rate plans associated with it
        but *only one* rate plan can be active at any point of time. **Note:
        From the developer's perspective, they purchase API products not rate
        plans.

        Creates an API proxy. The API proxy created will not be accessible at
        runtime until it is deployed to an environment. Create a new API proxy
        by setting the `name` query parameter to the name of the API proxy.
        Import an API proxy configuration bundle stored in zip format on your
        local machine to your organization by doing the following: * Set the
        `name` query parameter to the name of the API proxy. * Set the `action`
        query parameter to `import`. * Set the `Content-Type` header to
        `multipart/form-data`. * Pass as a file the name of API proxy
        configuration bundle stored in zip format on your local machine using
        the `file` form field. **Note**: To validate the API proxy configuration
        bundle only without importing it, set the `action` query parameter to
        `validate`. When importing an API proxy configuration bundle, if the API
        proxy does not exist, it will be created. If the API proxy exists, then
        a new revision is created. Invalid API proxy configurations are
        rejected, and a list of validation errors is returned to the client.

        Gets an API proxy revision. To download the API proxy configuration
        bundle for the specified revision as a zip file, set the `format` query
        parameter to `bundle`. If you are using curl, specify `-o filename.zip`
        to save the output to a file; otherwise, it displays to `stdout`. Then,
        develop the API proxy configuration locally and upload the updated API
        proxy configuration revision, as described in
        [updateApiProxyRevision](updateApiProxyRevision).
